functional patterns - functions, types and compositions

* Referential transparency
* immutability
* pure functions 
* total functions - input/output types are sets of all possible values
* functions as parameters
* some high order functions - map/fold/reduce...
* cathegories - monoids, functor, applicative, monads.
* using typed functional languages - Scala, F#...
